# offsec-learning-obsidian
Obsidian vault template for people learning about Offensive Security.

A large part of Offensive Security is being a student of security, and a place to note things that you have learned is important. There is not much to the template but it is a good starting place for growing you knowledge base. Obsidian provides great flexability so you are able to make this vault your own and customise it as much as you would like. HAVE FUN!!!
